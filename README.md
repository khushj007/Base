# Introduction

**Base** is a web application developed using Next.js, designed to read CSV files and display them as output, enabling user interaction.

I express my gratitude to [Icons8](https://icons8.com/icons) for allowing the use of their SVGs in this project. I highly recommend checking out their website.
